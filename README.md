## Behave

A simple behavior-driven development framework for testing Rust.

## Goal

Create a library that provides the simpliest DSL to express and test the behavior of Rust code.

## Versioning

Each minor version is a wip work on the specific module/functionality. It means that function signatures, names etc. may change in that stage.

Once the minor version gets changed to to the new one, we can consider the previous one stable. From that point forward each change to that module/s will need to have backward compatibility.

Major version is a breaking change that will make previous stable modules incompatible with new implementation.

## Currently working on:

- 0.1.x - core module - designing the library skeleton and basic DSL

## Roadmap

If you have ideas for a valid and bringing business value modules/functions. Please create an Issue to start a discussion. Contributions are also welcome.

## Licence

The library is under **Apache License, Version 2.0**
